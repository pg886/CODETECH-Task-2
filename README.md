**Overview of the project**

**Project:** Simple vulnerability scanning tool that scans a network or website for common security vulnerabilities such as open ports , outdated software versions and misconfigurations

**Objective** The vulnerability scanning tool aims to identify and report security weaknesses by detecting open ports, outdated software versions, and common misconfigurations. It helps uncover potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. The goal is to enhance overall security by enabling timely remediation.

**Key activities:** 
Key activities for the vulnerability scanning tool include:

1. **Port Scanning:** Identify and list open ports on the target to assess potential entry points.
2. **Software Version Checking:** Determine if the software is outdated and vulnerable by analyzing version information.
3. **Misconfiguration Detection:** Examine for common security misconfigurations, such as missing security headers or weak SSL/TLS settings.

**Python Libraries Used:**

socket: For checking open ports.
requests: For HTTP requests and header inspection.
nmap: For more detailed port scanning (using python-nmap wrapper).
ssl and OpenSSL: For checking SSL/TLS settings.
